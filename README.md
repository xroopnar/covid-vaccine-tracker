# COVID-19 Vaccination Rate Tracker 
Vaccination rate data pulled from the CDC's [County-level COVID-19 Vaccination Rate Data](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/distributing/reporting-counties.html) provided through their data portal.

Expanded version of my Dash app for interactively searching state by state vaccination rates, and vaccination rates over time as reported by the CDC.
